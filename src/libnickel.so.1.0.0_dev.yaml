Add orientation dropdown to developer options on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Developer Options (search devmodeon, then go to Device Information) has a section with a dropdown
      allowing changing the rotation to all options, including the inverted ones. This patch shows it on
      devices without a sensor. DOES NOT STICK.
  # In N3SettingsDeveloperOptionsView::N3SettingsDeveloperOptionsView(QWidget*):
  # replace the call to Device::hasOrientationSensor() to MOV r0, #0x1
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA6F504, FindH: AA F5 9C E6, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}
