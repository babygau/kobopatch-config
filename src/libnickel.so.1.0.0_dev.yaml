Change Browse Kobo home screen link target:
  - Enabled: yes
  - Description: |
      This patch allows you to change the target of the Browse Kobo link. To
      rename the top description, use the rename home screen footer patch.
  # The easy options for this patch are fairly limited, as BrowseKoboWidget::tapped
  # just calls the superclass event, then the call to DiscoverNavMixin::storeFront
  # in the PLT is tail-call optimized. This places a number of restrictions on the
  # replacement target, namely: the branch must be a branch and exchange, but not
  # link (lr must be unchanged to return correctly), which is implemented as a
  # 32-bit branch to a bx pc (nop branch, but still switch instruction sets)
  # immediately before a PLT entry to a nav mixin without any arguments (i.e.
  # must be static). Note that the first branch is relative to pc. Also, note that
  # in general, tbis requirement means anything called by StatusBarController (the
  # menu) can be used as a replacement.
  ##
  # In BrowseKoboWidget::tapped, change the tail-call to the bx before
  # ReadingLifeNavMixin::chooseActivity in the PLT, which opens the last-used
  # tab in the Reading Life page:
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9AB1BA, FindH: F2 F6 AB B2, ReplaceH: E8 F6 3F B6} # b.w sub_49d714 -> b.w sub_493e3c
  # In the BrowseKoboWidget constructor, change which function is called to get
  # the bottom text (Shop Kobo) from N3DeviceCharm::shopName (Shop Kobo / Walmart)
  # to N3DeviceCharm::extrasName (Activity) (note that there isn't enough room to
  # load an entirely different string here):
  - ReplaceBLX: {Offset: 0x9AAB7A, Find: 0x4AF398, Replace: 0x4A29EC}
  # For other options, ask geek1011.
