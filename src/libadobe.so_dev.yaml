Keep PDF pan position:
  - Enabled: yes
  - Description: |
      Prevents the pan from being reset when going to the next/previous page. TODO - find a way to make it work
### NOT WORKING:
# # The attempt below this didn't work, so this is the more hacky way to do it (returning (BX LR) early from resetPan).
# # This has the side effect of not resetting when rotating the screen either.
# - ReplaceBytesAtSymbol: {Symbol: "AdobeReader::resetPan()", Offset: 3, FindH: C0 F8, ReplaceH: 70 47}
### NOT WORKING:
# # At the end of the function, it branches to the code to reset the pan with a CBZ. This skips the actual
# # call (with LDR) to AdobeReader::resetPan():
# - ReplaceBytesAtSymbol: {Symbol: "AdobeReader::goToNextPage()", Offset: 147, FindH: 17 4B, ReplaceH: 00 20}
# - ReplaceBytesAtSymbol: {Symbol: "AdobeReader::goToPrevPage()", Offset: 141, FindH: 17 4B, ReplaceH: 00 20}
