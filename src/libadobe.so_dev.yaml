  # Skip over the additional reset in the function (idk why it's there, as it seems to do the same thing as AdobeReader::resetPan):

  # Note: This patch took a while to figure out, as I initially overlooked the second reset, and then once
  # I noticed it, I kept messing up the SP (and causing segfaults) when doing this a more complex way. I
  # eventually tried using a fixed pan and seeing if I got everything, then I did this patch again from
  # scratch.

# # Test (WORKS!): always 255, 255 pan
